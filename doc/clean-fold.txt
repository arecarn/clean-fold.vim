FUNCTIONS                                                 *clean-fold-functions*

clean_fold#fold_text({foldchar})
                Cleaner alternative to default fold text that includes the text
                on the line, then fills the rest of the fold line with
                {foldchar} and displays the number of folded lines on the
                middle side of the screen.

                Usage: (using '_' as the fill character) >

                        set foldtext=clean_fold#fold_text('_')
<

clean_fold#cleanest_fold_text()
                Just includes the text on the line except fold markers

                Usage: >
                        set foldtext=clean_fold#fold_text_minimal()


clean_fold#fold_expr({lnum})
                A new |foldexpr| set up so lines that are at the same indented level are
                folded along with the first line above them one indent level up. This fold
                expr was taken with basically no modification from Steve Losh's Learn
                Vimscript the Hard way's section on folding.
                Like indent folding but also include first line that is one
                indent level lower

                Usage: >
                        set foldmethod=expr
                        set foldexpr=clean_fold#fold_expr(v:lnum)
<
                In the example below there would be two folds (shiftwidth=4)

                Example: >
                        start of fold 1
                            part of fold 1
                            end of fold 1
                        start of fold 2
                            part of fold 2
                            end of fold 2
